# CardMatch

**CardMatch** is a simple and fun card-matching memory game designed for one player, where the objective is to find and match all pairs of cards with the fewest possible moves. This project was created as part of a hackathon challenge, showcasing our ability to design interactive games using modern web technologies.

While the current version is intended for single-player use, we plan to expand and implement a multiplayer mode in future versions. Stay tuned for updates! @

## Features

- **Single-player Mode**: Players flip cards to reveal hidden images and try to find matching pairs.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Move Counter**: Tracks the number of moves made to complete the game.
  
## Future Plans

For the purpose of this hackathon, **CardMatch** is built as a single-player experience. However, we are actively working on extending the game to include:
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete against friends to see who can match cards faster or with fewer moves.
- **Scoreboard**: Compare high scores and moves across multiple players.
- **Live Updates**: Real-time multiplayer updates for a more competitive experience.
